# Chat-Application.py
Here we have 2 files , HOST.py and SERVER.py .
We are applying multitheading in these programs where multiple clients can simutaneously communicate to server. 
For running these open 2 terminals and type --->   python client.py , python server.py 
Run the server first and then copy the system address from server side to paste it to client side . 
The programme shall also show which message has been delivered by which client.
